# State of Survival state map

State maps for State of Survival, ViV and viv alliances.

## State Map

The map is an svg image, generated from a csv file with location data for alliance objects.

An html file is also generated with the svg image embedded and the svg-pan-zoom library (see below), to allow easier navigation.

## svg-pan-zoom

The svg-pan-zoom javascript library can be found [here](https://github.com/bumbu/svg-pan-zoom).
